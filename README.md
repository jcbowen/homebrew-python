# Python@2 Homebrew Tap

Apple does not include Python 2 since macOS 12.3 update. This homebrew tap contains a formula with necessary patches that compiles and installs Python 2 natively on Macs with M1 chips.

## Usage

### Installation

```sh
brew install kamilturek/python2/python@2
```

### Uninstallation

```sh
brew uninstall kamilturek/python2/python@2
```
